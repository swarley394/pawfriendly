      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Golden Retrievers are fantastic dogs! They're known for their friendly temperament, intelligence, and beautiful golden coats. Originally bred in Scotland in the mid-19th century, they were developed to retrieve shot waterfowl during hunting.The Golden Retriever, an exuberant Scottish gundog of great beauty, stands among America's most popular dog breeds. They are serious workers at hunting and field work, as guides for the blind, and in search-and-rescue, enjoy obedience and other competitive events, and have an endearing love of life when not at work. The Golden Retriever is a sturdy, muscular dog of medium size, famous for the dense, lustrous coat of gold that gives the breed its name. The broad head, with its friendly and intelligent eyes, short ears, and straight muzzle, is a breed hallmark. In motion, Goldens move with a smooth, powerful gait, and the feathery tail is carried, as breed fanciers say, with a 'merry action.' The most complete records of the development of the Golden Retriever are included in the record books that were kept from 1835 until about 1890 by the gamekeepers at the Guisachan (pronounced Gooeesicun) estate of Lord Tweedmouth at Inverness-Shire, Scotland. These records were released to public notice in Country Life in 1952, when Lord Tweedmouth's great-nephew, the sixth Earl of Ilchester, historian and sportsman, published material that had been left by his ancestor. They provided factual confirmation to the stories that had been handed down through generations. Goldens are outgoing, trustworthy, and eager-to-please family dogs, and relatively easy to train. They take a joyous and playful approach to life and maintain this puppyish behavior into adulthood. These energetic, powerful gundogs enjoy outdoor play. For a breed built to retrieve waterfowl for hours on end, swimming and fetching are natural pastimes.  </p>

      <h2>Care</h2>
      <p>Golden Retrievers require regular exercise, grooming, and proper nutrition. Daily walks, mental stimulation, and social interaction are essential for their well-being. Regular grooming, including brushing their double coat, is important to minimize shedding.Golden Retrievers are known for their thick, water-repellent, lustrous golden coats. But their golden fur can range in color, so you can find white Golden Retrievers to red Golden Retrievers.

        No matter the color, Golden Retrievers have a double coat. This means that they have a thick undercoat of short hair covered by a layer of longer hair. Due to this double coat, Golden Retrievers shed a lot. They also tend to develop matted hair behind their ears and on their hind limbs. So, Golden Retrievers require a lot of grooming—either at home or by a professional groomer—to keep their coats healthy.</p>
