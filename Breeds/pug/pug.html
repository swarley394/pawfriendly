Pug owners say their breed is the ideal house dog. Pugs are happy in the city or country, with kids or old folks, as an only pet or in a pack.

      <h2>Care</h2>
      <p>Pugs aren't high-energy dogs, but they still need daily exercise. They also require consistent training and socialization to make sure they are well-mannered. And their grooming needs are fairly straightforward.Pugs need a moderate amount of exercise, roughly around an hour per day. A morning and evening walk plus some active playtime should be sufficient. Pugs also love participating with their humans in dog sports, such as agility and rally. And they enjoy puzzle toys to challenge them physically and mentally.

        The pug’s short coat is fairly easy to care for, only requiring basic grooming. Plan to brush weekly to remove loose fur and distribute skin oils. And bathe roughly once a month, depending on how dirty your dog gets. But at least weekly plan to use a soft damp cloth to clean the pug’s skin folds, especially around its face, as they are prone to infection. Make sure to dry the folds thoroughly.
