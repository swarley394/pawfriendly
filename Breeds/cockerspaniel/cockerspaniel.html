      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The merry and frolicsome Cocker Spaniel, with his big, dreamy eyes and impish personality, is one of the world's best-loved breeds. They were developed as hunting dogs, but Cockers gained their wide popularity as all-around companions. Those big, dark eyes; that sweet expression; those long, lush ears that practically demand to be touched'¿no wonder the Cocker spent years as America's most popular breed. The Cocker is the AKC's smallest sporting spaniel, standing about 14 to 15 inches. The coat comes in enough colors and patterns to please any taste. The well-balanced body is sturdy and solid, and these quick, durable gundogs move with a smooth, easy gait. Cockers are eager playmates for kids and are easily trained as companions and athletes. They are big enough to be sporty, but compact enough to be portable. A Cocker in full coat rewards extra grooming time by being the prettiest dog on the block. These energetic sporting dogs love playtime and brisk walks.Cocker Spaniels are dogs belonging to two breeds of the spaniel dog type: the American Cocker Spaniel and the English Cocker Spaniel, both of which are commonly called simply Cocker Spaniel in their countries of origin. In the early 20th century, Cocker Spaniels also included small hunting spaniels.

        Cocker Spaniels were originally bred as hunting dogs in the UK, with the term "cocker" deriving from their use to hunt the Eurasian woodcock. When the breed was brought to the United States, it was bred to a different standard, which enabled it to specialize in hunting the American woodcock. Further physical changes were bred into the cocker in the United States during the early part of the 20th century.

      <h2>Care</h2>
      <p>Standing at about 14-15 inches tall, the American Cocker Spaniel is the American Kennel Club’s smallest sporting spaniel. They have characteristically long, furry ears and come in 15 different standard coat colors. The body shape is well-balanced and strong, which allows them to be both sturdy and agile. The typical Cocker Spaniel lifespan is between 10-14 years, so they’ll be a longtime companion.

        Those famously lush ears, however, can make them susceptible to ear infections. Additionally, their long coats can predispose them to skin infections if not properly groomed and maintained.Frequent and regular brushing is required to maintain an American Cocker Spaniel’s fairly high-maintenance coat and help prevent matting. Regular brushing will also help manage shedding, which is a year-round affair for this breed thanks to their double coat.</p>
