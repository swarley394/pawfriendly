      <h2>Care</h2>
      <p>Brush her coat as needed, at least weekly. Doberman Pinschers generally have good teeth, and you can keep them perfect by brushing them at least twice a week! She is a sensitive dog and doesn't do well with harsh training methods or punishment; always end training on a positive note.With the right training, they can be very calm and well-tempered dogs, although their large size means they probably aren't the best breed for families with young children or first-time owners. Dobermanns are very energetic and will need plenty of mental and physical exercise to keep them happy and healthy.</p>
