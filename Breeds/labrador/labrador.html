      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The sweet-faced, lovable Labrador Retriever is one of America's most popular dog breeds, year after year. Labs are friendly, outgoing, and high-spirited companions who have more than enough affection to go around for a family looking for a medium-to-large dog.

        The sturdy, well-balanced Labrador Retriever can, depending on the sex, stand from 21.5 to 24.5 inches at the shoulder and weigh between 55 to 80 pounds. The dense, hard coat comes in yellow, black, and a luscious chocolate. The head is wide, the eyes glimmer with kindliness, and the thick, tapering 'otter tail' seems to be forever signaling the breed's innate eagerness. Labs are famously friendly. They are companionable housemates who bond with the whole family, and they socialize well with neighbor dogs and humans alike. But don't mistake his easygoing personality for low energy: The Lab is an enthusiastic athlete that requires lots of exercise, like swimming and marathon games of fetch, to keep physically and mentally fit.The Labrador Retriever is a versatile and friendly medium-to-large working dog known for its exceptional intelligence and gentle nature.</p>

      <h2>Care</h2>
      <p>Labs are best suited for homes where they can get plenty of exercise and training. They are high-energy dogs that need lots of attention. Their grooming is fairly simple, though they do shed quite a bit.Labs can become hyperactive and destructive if they don’t get enough daily physical activity and mental stimulation. Plan on at least two hours of exercise each day, such as walks, jogs, hikes, and active playtime. Because these are such people-focused dogs, they'd rather exercise with you than be left in a yard alone.

        Labs have smooth, water-resistant coats that require little more than basic grooming. However, the thick coat does tend to shed a lot, so at least a weekly brushing is important to remove loose fur and distribute skin oils. Also, Labs tend to shed more heavily in the spring and fall as the weather changes. So you'll likely have to brush multiple times per week to keep up with the loose fur. Fortunately, because their coat naturally stays pretty clean, Labs generally only need a bath every couple of months.

        Plan to trim nails roughly every month, depending on how much your dog wears them down. Also, aim to brush its teeth daily. And check the ears at least weekly for dirt, debris, and any signs of infection. Make sure to dry the ears after swimming and baths.      </p>
