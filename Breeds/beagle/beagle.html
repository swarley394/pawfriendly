      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Not only is the Beagle an excellent hunting dog and loyal companion, it is also happy-go-lucky, funny, and thanks to its pleading expression cute. They were bred to hunt in packs, so they enjoy company and are generally easygoing. There are two Beagle varieties: those standing under 13 inches at the shoulder, and those between 13 and 15 inches. Both varieties are sturdy, solid, and 'big for their inches,' as dog folks say. They come in such pleasing colors as lemon, red and white, and tricolor. The Beagle's fortune is in his adorable face, with its big brown or hazel eyes set off by long, houndy ears set low on a broad head. A breed described as 'merry' by its fanciers, Beagles are loving and lovable, happy, and companionable'¿all qualities that make them excellent family dogs. No wonder that for years the Beagle has been the most popular hound dog among American pet owners. These are curious, clever, and energetic hounds who require plenty of playtime.</p>

      <h2>Care</h2>
      <p>Beagles are generally considered medium-sized dogs, but they actually come in two sizes: One measuring under 12 inches at the shoulder and a larger size that ranges from 12-15 inches tall at the shoulder. No matter their size, a full-grown Beagle’s weight can range from 20-30 pounds. Males are usually bigger than females.  

        Beagles come in several colors, including lemon, red and white, and the more common tricolor of black, brown, and white. Beagles have a smooth, dense double coat and floppy ears, which need to be cleaned regularly to prevent ear infections. They also have long tails that seem to never stop wagging. As a result of wagging too much, Beagles can suffer from limber tail syndrome, also called swimmers' tail. This is a temporary, acute condition that results in a strain in the muscles used to keep the tail upright, causing a limp and sore tail. Limber tail syndrome usually resolves with a day or two of rest, but it can require pain medication to make your dog comfortable.  </p>
